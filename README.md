# LOGISTIC-REGRESSION

### IMPLEMENTION OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY

- Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique
- It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using  LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the model is calculated
